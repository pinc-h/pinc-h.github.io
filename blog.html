	<h3>Twitching for geese</h3>
	<p><b>October 8, 2024</b><br><br>
	I've deleted all the social media on my phone, which means in every idle moment I'm opening random apps and attempting to look at some sort of feed.
	This morning it was iNaturalist, where I see an observation made near me by a mutual, Erin. It's a group of Greater White-fronted Geese. Never heard of them. They look pretty though. 
	They're pecking in a baseball field outside the nearby rec center, just like our normal residents. I'm still considering myself a new birder, mostly to save myself the embarassment 
	of not knowing enough, and one step I haven't taken yet is going on a 'twitch': going out of my way to see a new bird. Well, this one's a 10 minute walk away. Off I go.<br><br>
	I haven't walked this way in a month, almost exactly. I tried (and failed) to forage blackberries with Hannah. The season change is apparent. I've had this rainjacket for years and 
	I've just discovered how to tighten the hood, so the patter makes less din and is soothing me. There definitely aren't any blackberries. I'm nervously crossing streets, as I do now 
	in Victorian rain. I make it to the weather-abandoned golf course and rec center. It was a few hours ago since the observation was made, so I figured I'd get a good walk around 
	the course looking for them. But I underestimated their goose tendencies. The rain had them sat still in the exact same place, in the baseball diamond. I crouched above the wet grass
  and took photos with my ancient DSLR. I could've sat in the dugout but I wanted to be closer to them. Eight individuals: two males and the rest either females or juveniles, I can't really 
	tell the difference. Oddly, the whole ordeal reminded me of Lake Averno, about 10 months ago in Italy. I was capitvated by a Swan-Goose hybrid there. It was an incredibly pretty male with a 
	similarly ridged bill and fronted face. Hardly the most exciting thing around Naples. I guess it sticks out because I wrote about it. I think I blogged about it but not sure, you'd 
	have to go check (Ctrl-f for me, will you? I'm too lazy). A very long way of saying I went to see geese today. The rain still feels new and seasonal dread hasn't set in.

  <h3>Cedar trees, childhood & warfare</h3>
  <p><b>September 24, 2024</b><br><br>
    There’s a shade of green I remember from when I was young. It’s in a forest of cedar with tall dusted hills surrounding it. Park-goers are friendly, I can’t 
    understand them but they smile anyway. My dad's asking for directions, in some pidgin-speak he seems to have perfected and they seem to tolerate. They tolerate it 
    here better than back home, and my dad remembers this about the trip. “Lebanon was awesome wasn’t it?” my dad nudges my shoulder. I’m in high school. The Telus booth 
    has two Lebanese girls tending it. He’s pulled out his Arabic (gibberish) again, to every bystander’s sorrow. “I could tell cause your accent!” They seem mildly 
    impressed at this. On the way home he tries to jog my memory of the trip, it’s important to him that I remember these things. I’m scrolling this morning, rubbing my 
    eyes, reading the headlines and smelling burning cedar. I remember.

  <h3>Update on my Wingspan© scores</h3>
  <p><b>September 14, 2024</b><br><br>
    Back in April I decided to plot my Wingspan scores (base game, no expansions) . After about 20 games, I didn't really see anything interesting, so I thought I'd keep recording for a while 
    to see if A) I'd start winning more and B) if I acquired different kinds of points. Well, I've got a few more games under my belt, and figured I could look again 
    at how I'm playing. I've mostly been playing 1v1's against the Hard AI. I don't feel like I've gotten a lot better, but there's a few things I've improved at. For one, 
    I'm actually looking at my opponents board. This is something you can entirely gloss over when you're starting out. I think I'm still learning what are 'the good birds'.
    But, once you know at least a few powerful cards to look out for, it becomes easier to keep tabs on your opponent. My playstyle has changed too, I'm no longer solely focused on 
    'eggsmaxxing', but a more rounded playstyle: looking for opportunities to gain points by tucking or the bird points themselves. However, I'm still falling for the end of round points 
    gambit, a last minute hail-mary for extra points that probably just wastes my turn. You'll notice just in the last few games that's decreased, hopefully that trend stays.<br>
   <div class="imgbox"><img width="700" class="center-fit" src="./images/wingspan_50games.webp"></div>
   <br>
   There's a few biases here too. For some of these games I was aiming for a particular Steam Achivement. Most recently I've been trying to get '60 bird points in a single game', 
   which has reduced my winrate as I seek out bigger-point and thus more costly birds. However, this forced change in my playstyle has been refreshing, and I'll probably continue 
   to minimize both my time laying eggs and prioritizing end of round goals.<br><br>
   To better illustrate my infrequent playing, I've plotted my wins over time. You'll see the games are fairly spaced out as I spend months without playing 
   and then 5 or 6 games in a night. I've only plotted my 1v1s against Hard AI, by far my most played game mode. I may start to play Multiplayer, I've joined a Wingspan Tournaments 
   server. If I do, I'll be sure to plot these data separately.<br><br>

   <h3>Spiral Beach on another Tuesday</h3>
   <p><b>August 6, 2024</b><br><br>
    I went to Spiral beach again to finish Dune: Chapterhouse. I ended up spending a long time looking at gorse (<i>Ulex europaeus</i>) and immersing myself in 
    ecological dread. Dune is ripe with allegory, from as simple as spice = oil, to more complicated portrayals of religious-fuelled states veering to fascism. 
    In Dune: Chapterhouse, sandworms are wreaking havoc on a new planet, churning up sand and uprooting vegetation. The weather warms and oceans dry. Everyone knows 
    it won’t be habitable for them much longer. But the worm’s precious byproduct fuels their world. The gorse wreaks havoc too, the flowers glistening with 
    flammable oil. There’s a picket sign on the beach everyone is ignoring: “There was a fire here.”  We seem to recognize the end too. Why am I reading a 50 
    year old book about it? <br><br> Maybe this is the answer, old and unchanged:<br>

   <h3>Spiral Beach on a Tuesday</h3>
   <p><b>July 30, 2024</b><br><br>
    Overcast reprieve. I walk to the beach, weaving in and out of busses. This would've been hard for me to do a few months ago. I’m acclimated to city life I think.
    At Spiral Beach the Olympics are hiding, I only see their feet behind the foggy curtain. A buzz from my phone reverberates into the pebbles. 
    It’s a text I’ve been waiting a few days for. I’m looking up and relishing in the moment when I see a pair of gulls flying in tandem.
    A foot is moving. It takes me a while to see that it’s a tanker, meandering the landscape. I’m trying really hard not to be too poetic about it all, 
    but I do love it here.<br><br>
    Behind me bumblebees float down a cliff-face filled with gumweed and flowering peas. I think I see a <i>Bombus occidentalis</i>, but it 
    could be my mind playing tricks on me.  Regardless, I'm enthralled. Rare species are everywhere and always popping up where you aren't looking. 
    I've heard bumblebees like to forage on overcast days, when the other bees and wasps are hiding. I think I've come here to hide too, and cuddle up under 
    the curtain. It really doesn't feel like summer today. And even though we have a month left it feels like it's ending too. I'll 
    be wrapping up my contract with the Gorge this week and after that I'm off to Saskatchewan and Alberta, in that order. The bees will be dead & sleeping 
    in that cooked grassland. Trying to read at the beach was unsuccessful. I'll finish Dune: Chapterhouse in Regina I guess.

   <h3>A Korean Macbook for $50</h3>
   <p><b>July 29, 2024</b><br><br>
    24 hours ago, I saw an ad for a 2009 Macbook Pro for $50. The battery is shot, it's got 4gb of RAM (barely enough to run chrome) and it's factory language is Korean. It was worthless 
    to the guy selling it, but as someone with a stack of CDs and a yearning for a shitbox coding playground, this was gold.<br><br>First, I wanted to see if I could 
    convert it English and re-install the Mac OS (Mac OS X Lion... very old). Of course, that was not too simple. When booting in Disk Utility, all menus were in Korean, so 
    I had to Google Translate with my phone camera. This process was not flawless. I had to piece together a lot of nonsense translations, some of which were purely indecipherable.<br>
    I eventually navigated to the menu where I could erase the disk, and that seemed to work. However, attempting to re-install MacOS was hard. It needed Wi-Fi (why?), and 
    gave me a very generic error after a good 30 min. Tried this a few times over, to no avail. <br>
    Okay, last ditch effort. If I'm out $50 I'm out $50. I flashed Ubuntu onto a USB and tried booting it from that. Now, 24hrs later, a little shaky circle turns and turns...<br><br>

  <h3>Mothing, Night Three: 3000km from site 1</h3>
  <p><b>July 12, 2024</b><br><br>
    Two months after hauling my moth light and spare bedsheet out to BC, I finally got it up. A very warm night that lended itself to bluegrass music, I hope the bugs didn't 
    mind. Hannah and I hung my mom's bedsheet tied to a clothesline around 9:30pm. A nearby German Yellowjacket nest (in Hannah's eavestrough) attracted 
    an early victim (10:05pm). Sorely confused, this yellowjacket buzzed around the light, wiping its antennae furiously and bumping into us as the night went on. 
    I don't believe he ever left. The next visitor was one I recognized (10:06), an Ophioninae, a night-flying wasp! Saw this guy in Ontario with Evan, which was fitting 
    because it was his birthday July 12th. At 10:08pm, our favourite of the night appeared. Buzzing in at blaring speed, perpendicular to the sheet, and collapsing to 
    the porch floor: a long-haired june beetle <i>(Polyphylla crinita)</i>! We were enamoured for a while, he was very confused, and after he was affixed to the bedsheet 
    (after much coaxing), we had many more moths to look at.<br>
    <ul>
    <li>10:16pm - Common Emerald Moth (<i>Hemithea aestivaria</i>)</li>
    <li>10:17pm - <i>Alceris spp.</i></li>
    <li>10:18pm - <i>Plutella spp.</i></li>
    <li>10:22pm - Codling Moth (<i>Cydia pomonella</i>)</li>
    <li>10:25pm - <i>Stamnoctenis spp.</i></li>
  </ul>
  In the interest of curbing the loading time of this HTML, I've decided not to embed more photos. But, everything mentioned has been uploaded on iNat. For a specific 
  search of everything I saw last night, see 
  <a href="https://inaturalist.ca/observations?nelat=48.43776679952016&nelng=-123.33787746252419&on=2024-07-12&place_id=any&subview=map&swlat=48.43480568116167&swlng=-123.34311313452126&user_id=pinch&verifiable=any">here.</a>
  <br><br>
  Overall, a great night. I would hazard a greater diversity, but smaller in size, than in Leith Ontario. The Common Emerald was awesome, but not as dazzling as the <i>Feralia jocosa</i> 
  I saw with Ev. The June bug (three more joined him later) was probably the highlight, weirdly enough. Darnedly charismatic that one. Okay I'll include one photo.<br><br>

  <h3>Gulls are <i>easy</i>* (Getting birdpilled, two)</h3>
  <p><b>May 14, 2024</b><br><br>
    Alright, more about gulls. Last night I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/birdmoder/status/1787881981138927619">this tweet</a> about a poorly-made dichotomous key for gulls, 
    and it reminded me of my very poorly made Venn diagram I made a week ago (see below). This key was poorly made because 1. that's Arial and 2. gulls are not that easy whatsoever. 
    However, I don't know much more than whoever made that awful looking key so I have endeavoured to recreate it to my taste. Here is my attempt.
    <br><br><div class="imgbox"><img width="1000" class="center-fit" src="./images/gulls_key.webp" float="left"></div>
    <br>I have half a mind to print these off business-card sized and hand them out, but I know if I do I face the wrath of the birding community. Please spare me, the gull hybrids are 
    our real enemies.<br>

  <h3>Gulls are simple (Getting birdpilled, one)</h3>
  <p><b>May 8, 2024</b><br><br>
    I picked up an Audubon of North American Birds recently (on my slow journey into the world of aves), and saw someone scribbled on the inside cover: a T-chart of 
    the different gull characteristics. I've had people tell me gulls are hard to ID, so I thought I'd make a quick diagram to clear this up for everybody. I'm a fresh 
    set of eyes and also obviously know more than any other birder who has ever lived. You may notice this doesn't follow any convention for a scientific figure, and 
    may or may not be missing critical information, this is purposeful. Like most writing here, this isn't entirely educational as it is a fun way to share my learning.

  <h3>Uplands in bloom</h3>
  <p><b>May 2, 2024</b><br><br>
    I'm fresh off the plane, back on the island I've missed so dearly for 8 months. Yesterday was chaos: moving, seeing friends, salty air.
    It was the strangest feeling, like I was somewhere I shouldn't be. Back in Leith there's a humble bunkie with a muddy driveway and a dead silent lawn. Here, flowers are in 
    bloom, far from the quiescence I was uncovering from the occasional snow. Yesterday, at the bar with my long-unseen friends, I revealed I'd never actually been to a Garry 
    Oak meadow in bloom. Four years here (surely centuries ago), and I'd never made it out to see this endangered ecosystem everybody raves about. Hannah suggested 
    I get a bus pass and go to Uplands Park tomorrow. So that's what I did.<br><br>
    Uplands Park is situated in a rich area of Victoria called Oak Bay. The streets are narrow and well-forested, expensive cars with learners-stickers plague the driveways. 
    As I hop off the bus, blasting Steely Dan in my aching ears, I'm confronted with nannies finishing their morning shift. They're shuffling aboard the bus home. 
    It is around 10am. I stroll the suburb for 10 minutes before finding the back entrance to the park. Last time I was here I attended an Insect BioBlitz, where a bunch of 
    nerds much more knowledgable than me caught a dizzying array of bugs for iNaturalist clout. Now, I'm here alone with my decade old DSLR. I'm staring at every bug like it's 
    brand-spanking-new, because they kind of are to my Ontario eyes. I see a lot I recognize, a few I don't. A few I thought I recognized I had the wrong name for all last summer. 
    I was so hopeful the island had Tri-coloured Bumblebees (<i>Bombus ternarius</i>) last summer, but I've come to realize that they were all Orange-rumped (<i>B. melanopygus</i>). Oops. 
    I saw two <i>B. melanopygus</i>, scurrying between low-hanging clover. I saw a very black looking bumblebee, which I really couldn't make out. Maybe a cuckoo. It would be 
    interesting if I could find a <i>B. impatiens</i>, which are apparently shifting into BC. I saw bee-flies too, the really characteristic orange-fuzzy guys that hover much more 
    efficiently than their Hymenopteran relatives. Bombyllidae I want to say. The sun was so bright and high all flyers cast a shadow, and you could almost tell the flies and bees 
    apart by their movement patterns. I'm cracking my knees, bending as close to flowers as I can without a macro-lens attached. When I get up again (<i>crack crack crack</i>), the 
    Camas has dusted my lens. I've been observing too hard. My camera is touching the world around me, and my camera is attached to me, and I'm attached to the world, is my jet-lagged 
    logic chain. My cracking knees and ankles are kicking up nesting habitat, amongst thousands of flowers, amongst thousands of arthropods evolved to visit them. I put my camera away.<br><br>
    Clouds appear as the day lulls by. The park is still empty because it is a Thursday. I'm twisting my neck under the Garry Oaks, admiring drooping lichen and letting my eyes unfocus 
    on it all. A cloud hides the sun and the light goes grayscale. Little glimpses of the St. Thomas eclipse I saw last month come back to me. That was a truly strange light, this is 
    a weak imitation. But the lichen take on a new form, like the tiger losing it's conspicuousness in the eyes of a deer. When the sun comes back, a particular lichen I focused on starts 
    to writhe. It's not lichen at all, but a yellowjacket on the underside of a thin bough. It's stripes were invisible to me in this mottled gray sea. A new way of looking at the world, 
    thanks Annie Dillard.

  <h3> Mothing, Night Two</h3>
  <p><b>April 27, 2024</b><br><br>
    The second night of mothing, exactly two weeks later, was conducted on an extremely humid and warm evening. The weather forecasted for rain but due to time constraints 
    (I leave the province in a few days), I went ahead regardless. I took no notes (stupid). I think by most accounts you could call this more successful, a greater 
    number and diversity of moths showed, as well as some beetles and night-flying wasps previously unobserved. Below are some rough notes, like last time, but written 
    after-the-fact late last night.<br><br>
  Rough Notes:<br>
  <ul>
  set-up:<br>
  The sun set at 8:24pm. very muggy, 77% humidity and up to 16 degrees at 2pm.<br>
  Turned on the light at 9pm. Again very little activity for the first few hours. I did not take notes throughout, times are from photo metadata.<br>
  Many many mayflies/unknown midges attracted to the bedsheet. Highly irritating, flew into ears nose and mouth if stood between light and the sheet.<br><br>
  <li>First moth: 9:40pm. Pterophoridae/plume moth.</li>
  <li>9:43pm, Noctuidae/dart moth.</li>
  <li>9:45pm, Noctuidae/dart moth. This one crawled into a crevice between the sheet and the house wall and didn’t emerge for a few minutes</li>
  <li>9:57pm, coolest find of the night. Green speckled moth that reminded me of the Grote’s Sallow from two weeks ago. iNat AI said Genus Feralia.</li>
  <li>10:02pm, Noctuidae, flew straight down onto the porch, remained in an awkward head-down position. Presumably injured.</li>
  <li>10:03pm, At first glance Noctuid but iNat says Notodontidae. A first of this family for me! Again this individual was in an awkward position, with head facing down 
    between the boards of the porch. A prominent arch on the back is visible in the photo.</li>
  <li>10:04pm, another Noctuid. One geometer(?) near the ground moving very little, capsized and moving its wings slowly like a butterfly in the sun. If not injured, near-death.</li>
  <li>10:14pm, A unique geometer on the sheet, iNat says of the genus Cladara, from the subfamily Larentiinae (Carpet Moths) </li>
  <li>10:21pm, A Noctuid on the eavestrough comes deep from treeline. Fairly certain this is a new indiv.</li>
  <li>10:24pm, First Copivaleria of the night! It lands below the sheet and flies and midges begin to walk over it immediately. Lack of movement made me suspect it 
    was near death.</li>
  <li>10:44pm, Another Geometer/perhaps Cladara. The UV light reflects the white lines on its wings in my image.</li>
  <li>10:45pm, Another Noctuid/perhaps Orthosia.</li>
  <li>10:51pm, A more lively Copivaleria appears, I don't get a stable photo of it. The shakiness of the photo almost attenuates its dizzying speckled pattern.</li>
  <li>10:57pm, A unique looking one, I only get a photo from the side before it leaves, and without flash. The colours are like the Noctuids I've been seeing but 
    its body is more slender, and its wings tapered at the ends. It makes a distinct triangle shape at rest. I trust the iNaturalist AI less with this photo but it 
    suggests genus Mythmina in the Noctuidae family.</li>
  <li>11:06pm, The feralia returns! Or perhaps a new individual, but having only seen one hours prior it seems rare compared to the swathes of noctuids.</li>
  <li>11:10pm, A jet-black noctuid is camouflaged on the porchboard. iNaturalist AI can't get it further than Noctuinae.</li>
  <li>11:27pm, On the doorframe of the house, left of the bedsheet, I see an ornate looking geometer. iNaturalist identifies it to species, a Bent-lined Carpet.</li>
  <li>Takedown: 11:30</li>
  </ul>
  <br> Impossible to do counts here but I'd guess at least 30 individuals seen over the night, the vast majority noctuids. The 'rares' included Pterophoridae, Notodontidae, 
  and the noctuid Feralia and Copivaleria.All-in-all I think a very successful night, exciting to see colourful individuals like the Feralia and Copivaleria. I am sure I or 
  iNaturalist have misidentified a few. In such a case, please correct me via <a href="https://inaturalist.ca/users/pinch">iNaturalist</a>. I'm sad to be leaving the area on 
  the cusp of moth season. However, I'm sure I'll try this out in British Columbia this summer, with a whole new suite of species to find.<br><br>

  <h3>Mothing, Night One</h3>
  <p><b>April 13, 2024</b><br><br>
    I purchased a UV light from Amazon, and used a carpenter's work light, both pointed toward a Queen-sized white bedsheet taped to the wall of my house. 
    My goal was to attract moths for a few hours on a cold early spring night. Weeks prior, I had observed two dart-moths, as well as some general activity of 
    mayflies and midges are out around the porch lights. For identification, I relied on iNaturalist and 
    <a href="https://www.andrewisles.com/pages/books/939/charles-v-covell/a-field-guide-to-the-moths-of-eastern-north-america">"A Field Guide to Moths of Eastern 
    North America</a> by Charles V. Covell (1984). I set up my apparatus at 9:30pm. It was 5 degrees celsius, and I had the intention to take it down when the 
    temperature was projected to drop to 0 degrees. Below are my <i>in-situ</i> notes, fat-fingered in the cold.
    <ul>
    <li>Set up- 9:30</li>
      <li>9:56
        <ul>
          <li>2- geometrers??</li>
          <li>1- draping, “cape”.. noctuidae??</li>
          <li>Seemed interested in black light, frantic, wouldn’t settle on bedsheet</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10:17
        <ul>
          <li>IM COLD AND NOTHING IS STaying here LONG ENOUGH</li>
          <li>4deg, was 5</li>
          <li>Need to make it at least another hour (11:30)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>10:51- 2 dart-moth looking indiv. Both photoless</li>
      <li>REALLY COOL black and white moth that I caught so I could get a better photo</li>
      <ul>
        <li>May have taken a trochanter with my palm…, very sad. I released him but didn’t seem to move well afterwards. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>10:54- another one. Caramel brown, tiny tiny dark spot on it</li>
      <li>10:57- another, fairly certain new because came in from the forest</li>
      <li>Plume moth!!! Couldn’t get too close but small and characteristic “straight line” wings visible. Cream coloured</li>
      <li>11:01 another black and white speckled!!</li>
      <li>11:05 noticing lots of snow flies(?) on the black light side of the sheet. Need to move the UV so the light hits the sheet fully</li>
      <li>11:08 black and white speckled caught behind sheet lol can’t get him out</li>
      <li>11:09 another bw speckled has come to the sheet</li>
      <ul>
        <li>11:15 both in the same side now, just chilling.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Moon is covered now. Might be why I’m getting more activity</li>
      <li>Inat says bw speckled is Grote’s sallow or figure eight sallow</li>
      <li>Sporadic indiv. didn’t land, looked a bit like the plume in flight</li>
      <li>Takedown: 11:30</li>
      <br>
      Total counts:<br>
      3 sallow, 2 photo'd (Family: Noctuidae, Genus: Copivaleria, iNat)<br>
      3 dart moths/not sure no photos (Family: Noctuidae, just a guess)<br>
      1 dart moth photo’d (Family: Noctuidae, Genus: Orthosia, iNat)<br>
      2 geometers/not sure (Family: Geometridae, fairly certain)<br>
      2 plumes no photos (Family: Pterophoridae, fairly certain)<br>
    </ul>
    Some notes for future mothing/what I've gleaned:<br>
    Without a proper net, moths should not be handled no matter what. The Copivaleria I handled moved erratically and was obviously injured by my attempt to get a 
    close-up photo of its wing pattern. Despite the cold, I observed a decent amount of activity. There was little wind and it was a warm evening (for the area/time 
    of year). The moths were definitely attracted to the light but failed to settle on the sheet for the first hour it was up. It is possible my movement/activity 
    deterred them from landing. I suspect in the coming weeks a greater diversity of moths could be observed, with warmer weather projected. I will likely try again 
    on a warm night, preferably before mosquito-season. The counts should be taken with caution as individuals came and left the apparatus frequently. For instance I 
    observed the two geometers and two plumes hours apart.<br>
    Here's the photos I took of the Copivaleria and Geometers.<br><br>

  <h3>Plotting my Wingspan© scores... for some reason...</h3>
    <p><b>April 4, 2024</b><br><br>
      Amidst a windstorm and without power in Leith/Annan, I booted up Wingspan© on my laptop. I saved my games locally, in the hopes that 
      when the wi-fi turned back on my progress would sync. I then had a horrible idea to track my scores, and see if there's any patterns in how 
      I play. I drank whisky and basked in the blue-glow of my screen while trees snapped outside. I got about 20 games in before my laptop died. 
      Here's how they look.<br><br>
      <div class="imgbox"><img width="400" class="center-fit" src="./images/wingspan_plot1.webp"/></div>
      <br>
      No general trend here... a few rough games to start but it doesn't look like I got any better. A small sample of games to see large strategic improvement I 
      suppose. Now for the real juice-- how I get my points. I am a big fan of the "laying eggs" function, since each egg is worth 1 point, it makes it a great way to 
      maximize score early. Similar to the "tucking" strategy that the expansions make so viable, this scheme builds on itself: more eggs means more birds to play 
      that can lay more eggs which means more birds to play which means I can lay more eggs which means I can play mor-<br>
      Nothing more satisfying than a well-oiled engine. I suspected that eggs would be where I'd be getting most of my points.<br><br>
      <div class="imgbox"><img width="500" class="center-fit" src="./images/wingspan_plot2.webp"/></div>
      <br><br>
      Lo-and-behold, eggs aren't even close to the majority my points. Maybe this strategy isn't doing as much for me as I thought. It doesn't seem like I'm tucking 
      a lot either, but maybe with the expansions I'd change my play-style. I'll be adding more to this as I play more games, it'll be interesting to see 
      where I am after I sink more hours into this. I still believe in the potential of eggsmaxxing... I'll just have to keep tracking I guess. I've kept track of 
      some of the AI's scores as well, it would be interesting to see if there's specific strategies they employ. It's my impression that the AI's score scales a 
      bit with your own; there wasn't a game that the AI differed from my score more than 30 pts, even in games 3 and 4 where I scored abysmally. Special thanks to 
      <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats">Nan Xiao</a>, who made the ggsci R package that I used for this palette. And here's 
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexpinch/6715d03502b9d24440e67ea75f28a3e2">the R script</a> if you're so inclined.

  <h3>Moths and warm weather, little to no reflection</h3>
  <p><b>March 5, 2024</b><br><br>
    I am compelled to write because the sun is out, & I can trick myself into a spring sobriety by writing all fancy-like. I have been reading Louis Agassiz's work, 
    an old Swiss man to whom American universities owe a great deal, regrettably. He calls a letter he wrote "a circular letter" because it has no aim & meanders 
    along without any clear intent. Inspired, I'm writing one now.<br><br>
    It's disgustingly warm out these days. A spooky warm, like I fell into a coma for 3 months in the dead of winter & awoke on the cusp of summer. Spring is a 
    memory this year. It seems to be fleeting and faded. I see no bulbs or sprouts yet-- only mud, caked in 20 degree heat that has never belonged to this time of 
    year. One good thing has come  out of this clime though, and thats a few dart moths have emerged and hang around the light by our 
    porch door. I really hope they haven't been tricked by this transient temperature, if they make their offspring surely they won't survive another big hit of 
    snow. I know nothing about their life cycles, maybe there's hundreds of them in the bush, flurrying in the moonlight.<br><br>

  <h3>Last day in Italy</h3>
    <p><b>November 28, 2023</b><br><br>
      I took the subway to Montesanto again, where I caught the Cumana train to Lucrino, just outside Pozzuoli. It was spitting off-and-on, but I caught a glorious 
      break in the clouds at the beach across from the train station. I swam finally, in the Tyrrhenian, and dried off listening to DOOM. The wind picked up, and 
      the sand peppered me like a gatling gun, so I packed up and left. Collected some shells and I think some pumice to leave at the tunnel under the train tracks. 
      Maybe pumice, maybe styrofoam. If it's pumice, it might be Vesuvian volcanic, which is incredible. There's an archeological park offshore a ways, I saw from 
      iNaturalist that its a superb diving spot. Made me want to get my PADI license. The iNat photos featured wrasse and damselfish, swimming above Roman mosaic 
      floors submerged from rising sea levels.<br><br>
      I've come to the conclusion I like old Italians more than younger ones. They're more willing to speak slowly and have incredible patience for my broken 
      Italian. An old couple sat beside me in a bar in Pozzuoli. The husband struck up a conversation with me. He asked if I speak French since I'm from Canada. 
      Another older man asked me that the first time I was coming back from Pozzuoli. I had to break it to both of them, no. This man says next, verbatim: "My wife, 
      not know English. She smoke too much." While putting his fingers to his lips as if holding a dart. I missed exactly what he said next, either "My wife have 
      too much.. alcohol(?)" or "time"... and then points downward saying "qui". As he half-stands talking to me, she gets up to leave, and I notice her age in 
      her movement. He instinctually puts his arm out to steady her. "Married 85 years." I hear him say. I don't really believe what I've heard, until he puts his 
      fingers up, 8 and then 5. Maybe just together 85 years... teenage sweethearts. Otherwise I'm looking at people over 100 years old. That was my last surreal 
      moment of the day.<br><br>

  <h3>Pozzuoli</h3>
    <p><b>November 26, 2023</b><br><br>
      On the Cumana train to Pozzuoli I saw a lot of graffiti. A crudely drawn stick man with the title: BOB REA DEI NAPOLI (King Bob of Naples). I love this 
      almost American internet-style humour. It gives me a sense of commonality when everything around me is different. A woman boarded the train and went "brr", 
      rubbing her arms. Somehow she did it in Italian. Also, only Italian bars will go from the most beautiful ballad in Italian to Kesha's Tiktok into Katy Perry.<br><br>
      Leaving Pozzuoli:<br>
      Like every other tourist, I have imagined a potential life here, hastily and poorly envisaged. You would hate me for this 
      caricature I'm sure, but it will stay with me forever. When I write, little pieces of this place will seep its way in. The Tyrrhenian was cold and lonely, 
      but I'll still remember it with a fondness, a place where I could let the sights can change how I think.<br>
      My ego feels shredded here. My Italian is not celebrated, but not judged either. I feel myself scraping by, asking others to repeat themselves in a slower 
      and calmer tone. I feel cared for, passed gently between help-desks: Here is an Inglese, handle with care. Speak slowly to him and make sure he knows where 
      he's going. Any pride I could have is gone, and thats probably a good thing. I know when I'm in Canada again it will come back. I'll not ask for directions, 
      or ask for information to be repeated to me.

  <h3>Celebrating from a Naples park bench</h3>
    <p><b>November 25, 2023</b><br><br>
      The park is empty. It's cold and my ears hurt. Every Neapolitan has 4 layers on, like its February. Now this is wet cold- I'm not shivering but my hand moves 
      like molasses. Sono mi compleanno. The mountains across the Bay of Naples are very clear. This bench is wet. My hand is slowly getting faster though. 
      I think I'm lonely, I'm not sure how to fix that. Talking on the phone or sharing funny internet things doesn't really make me feel fulfilled. Maybe I am 
      extroverted after all. There's snow on Mount Vesuvius. I'm off to Lido Mappatella to dip my toes in the ocean. I'll wash my boots of Ontarian road salt and 
      Pompeii ash.

  <h3>Cisterns</h3>
    <p><b>November 24, 2023</b><br><br>
      I saw some cisterns on the Palatine hill. Due to the swampy geography of Rome, people have lived on this hill for a long time-- elevated above the muck. 
      This is probably why the purported cave Romulus and Remus were raised in is on the Palatine slopes. At one point these cisterns sat at the entrance to 
      Augustus' home-complex. It was in the modern excavation of these cisterns they found old coins, offerings to forgotten gods, and bones. These all sat 
      beneath the Roman concrete that lined the bottom of the pool. Surely back then they knew these things were old... but did they care? 
      Did the pits their ancestors were sacrificed into become garden ornaments?

  <h3>Last day in Rome</h3>
    <p><b>November 22, 2023</b><br><br>
      At the McDonalds in Roma Termini, waiting for my train to Napoli. There isn't any of the beeping I'm used to. So much of our dystopia is asinine and 
      fruitless, even in the cruel sadistic sense. The workers here still have that 1000 yard stare. <br><br>
      Some thoughts on my return to Napoli: <br>
      We should support our hockey teams the way Italians support their football teams. Banners from every store, rafter and clothes lines littered, I mean 
      literally littered. They look tossed and forgotten. 
      It looks like they never cleaned up the parade... only for me to find out Napoli's club came in third this year. Third!

  <h3>Rapid-fire taxi backseat ideas</h3>
    <p><b>November 20, 2023</b><br><br>
      In my taxi on my way to the Vatican, I wrote some thoughts on my phone. Here they are. <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Placing too many pins on Apple Maps to possible visit</li>
        <li>Crossed the Tiber. Had an instinct to reach and grab an orange hanging outside the cab. I didn't.</li>
        <li>Was Rome always this tropical? The birds...</li>
        <li>People assuming I'm American. I said caffè! I probably butchered it.</li>
        <li>Accidentally ordered salmon instead of salami. Should've said salsiccia I know the word. Fear of being judged has me acting more American than 
        anything else I guess.</li>
        <li>Italian Pop Smoke? Heard out of another cab. Also heard a K-pop song out of a Fiat.</li>
        <li>Navy (the colour) is very "in" right now. Can't  tell if its a tourist colour or if Romans are in love with it.</li>

  <h3>Notes from the train into Rome</h3>
    <p><b>November 19, 2023</b><br>
      <br>Some notes from the train into Rome, which happened a few days ago now but oh well.<br><br>
      A) I would like to learn some more about these Stone Pines. Their peculiar shape intrigued me, especially compared to the great evergreen Christmas trees my 
      Canadian eyes are used to. They seem to represent the quasi-tropical climate on this latitude that continues to confuse me. (Side note, as of 
      Nov. 21 I have seen 6 parakeets and 3 orange trees! Sorry to muddy the timeline, back to transcribing Nov 19 train notes). Okay to describe their shape: lacking 
      lower limbs, spread out circularly at the top, all leaves (needles? Need a closer look) pointing up. The ecological sifnigicance of this, in my mind, could be 
      two-fold. First, a cost-effective way to absorb sunlight. No costly lower limbs to maintain that acquire little to no sunlight. Second, abundant sun! 
      Exploit this clime and specialize into sucking up every ray. However, a few problems I can't solve: why are they found in clumps, with no other plants taking 
      advantage of the understory? Surely this limbless-trait of the stone pines was not adopted from competition with other trees, or to conserve space. I will look up 
      more about this before I embarass myself further.<br><br>
      B) I had a bit of a religious moment on the train. From my plane the landscape was beautiful, but from the train, the Appenines took a godly form. I could 
      understand Roman paganism from this vantage point. The sun cast through the clouds onto hamlets. Smoke rose from a chalet isolated from the town. Dozens of sheep, 
      tended by a man with a stick... a Biblical scene. A radio tower on a hill that I was convinced was a steeple of a church, until we bounded closer. We reached 
      200km/hr and my ears popped going through the mountain tunnels. Terracotta roots in those towns, the same red as in Pompeii I saw yesterday. A tractor, 
      whose tires turned in slow motion to the speed of the train. This ferrovaria is a gift, to see the country with such ease. I want to take it further and 
      abandon my stop... an hour is too short to absorb it all.<br><br> Why, in all this space, had they decided to live so close together? All these little villages 
      across Campagna. Some artifact of a deeper time, when we needed and leaned on each other, and couldn't get into our isolating macchina and go home. Each hamlet, 
      with houses tall and crammed together on the hillside, looked like a family. I suppose they were.<br><br> I paid for my coffee this morning and the man said no 
      when I got up to leave. He forced me to sit down and take my time. It was not a nicety. It was an insult to his service to move quickly. <br><br> I think if it 
      rained here (in the country of Italy), I would cry. Surely this has never happened, as this is the last vestige of paradise on Earth. (Side note, it rained in 
      Rome on Nov 20, I didn't cry but everyone's mood was definitely darkened).

  <h3>Frankfurt flight</h3>
    <p><b>November 15, 2023</b><br>
      <br>The CN Tower looks clean and crisp, must be the air this time of year. The summer-haze is gone. It's not even 4 and dusk has settled. The great tarmac 
      serengetti is alive with roaming packs of luggage carts, and insectile fluorescent vests. The lady beside me doesn't speak English. This feeling is familiar,
      like a family holiday, but with no one to turn to speak to.
      <br><br>
      Coming into Frankfurt at night, the streets looked like suburbia. Surely this arterial American disease has not spread its way here.
      There were a lot more streetlights. Towers with way too many red airplane warning lights (I count exactly six on each rooftop). In between 
      these curving streets were great pools of black, I associate them with lakes, but I've realized they're forests. The dimmest of tail-lights specked 
      them, and headlights shone through these pits like flashlights in a horror movie, cascading cones that faded a few feet in front of them.<br><br>
      The windows fogged once we landed. The trees across the tarmac stood like slender white ghosts, barely perceptible in the black. The sun rose 
      once I got to my gate. The clouds looked German: scrunchy and ready to say "Guten morgen" a bit too loudly. Everyone is busy and knows what 
      to do. I feel like I might be the only one really here.

  <h3>Another entirely too personal anecdote</h3>
    <p><b>August 4, 2023</b><br>
      <br><p>My Dad and I both have ADHD. I remember his advice at 17: set priorities, don’t doddle, sit down and focus, really focus.
    I thought back then he wasn’t speaking to me, but to his teenage self. As I get older, I’m painfully aware of how much 
    he was talking to me. To see one’s problems play out again in front of them is a horror my Dad never deserved. 
    To try and earnestly prevent them again for me is more than I could ever ask. <br><br>
    On a related tangent (as he used to say), I’d sometimes realize 3 hours into our monthly 15-minute phone call that there wasn’t 
    anybody on the planet like this man. And that these conversations mean more than the world to me. These phone calls would begin with
    “I have a midterm tomorrow morning…” Answered with: “That’s okay I’m halfway out the door to Home Depot.” 3 hours later, we’re 
    talking about Cleopatra and the size of Roman carts. Or the glacial lake beds that everybody in Owen Sound drives over everyday. 
    Conversations spilled out of us: it was the easiest thing in the world. It’s been the hardest thing in the world to lose. <br>
    Happy birthday Dad.

  <h3>On blogs as a too-quickly forgotten medium and why I am writing one</h3>
    <p><b>March 7, 2023</b><br>
      <br> I suppose I will start with a personal anecdote: I lost my father to cancer two weeks ago.
      Grief is a powerful motivator, and suddenly the fear of making a fool of myself on the internet has dissipated.
      Perhaps a stupid way to start this, because I will not be talking about it more. For my first blog post, let's talk about blogs.
      <br><br>
      Twenty or so years ago the internet changed how we share about ourselves. I was also born then, so I am partial to these first few years of blood-curdling 
      modem screams. A plain-text HTML file became the modus operandi for the technologically literate, from sharing their day-to-day to weird little stick figure 
      comics (I am particularly fond of xkcd thanks to my high school programming teacher). From what I have heard, as I was far too young to remember, people that 
      started blogs began to have a bit of a reputation. Sharing all about yourself on the internet was not common in those days, before the advent of social media 
      and its ilk. Blogging was not particularly popular: "geek" was still in the population's vocabulary and every negative stereotype associated with it. Towards 
      the end of the aughts, as they are increasingly called, social media rose from the basements of Silicon Valley, poised to grasp our then well-functioning Aunts 
      and Uncles into the tendrils of conspiracy groups a little over a decade later.
      <br><br>
      If my disenfranchisement with the state of the internet is not clear yet, I am disenfranchised with the state of the internet. There is too much to sift 
      through and what is left in the sieve is not that remarkable anyway. In a time where this could all have been generated by a large language model, I find 
      myself asking if there is any way to prove I even exist, let alone grab someone's attention. In an even bleaker aspect, how to grab someone's attention who is 
      not used to reading letters on a lonely white void. More and more, I find myself on little islands in the world wide web, grasping to a forum here or a group 
      chat there. The internet might work best in small communities after all, which I hope is what Mastodon has right. So, with humility, I am carving out this 
      piece of the internet the old-fashioned way. Typing in an HTML file, committing to main, hoping what I write is entertaining or informative. This void provides 
      no feedback of any kind to tell me I am doing okay. Slowly, I am learning not to look back so much and keep pedalling forward. 
      Dad's got his hands off the bicycle now.<br><br>
