      <h3>Last day in Italy</h3>
      <p><b>November 28, 2023</b><br><br>
      I took the subway to Montesanto again, where I caught the Cumana train to Lucrino, just outside Pozzuoli. It was spitting off-and-on, but I caught a glorious 
      break in the clouds at the beach across from the train station. I swam finally, in the Tyrrhenian, and dried off listening to DOOM. The wind picked up, and 
      the sand peppered me like a gatling gun, so I packed up and left. Collected some shells and I think some pumice to leave at the tunnel under the train tracks. Maybe pumice, maybe styrofoam. If it's pumice, it might be Vesuvian volcanic, which is incredible. 
      There's an archeological park offshore a ways, I saw from iNaturalist that its a superb diving spot. Made me want to get my PADI license. The iNat photos 
      featured wrasse and damselfish, swimming above Roman mosaic floors submerged from rising sea levels.<br><br>
      I've come to the conclusion I like old Italians more than younger ones. They're more willing to speak slowly and have incredible patience for my broken 
      Italian. An old couple sat beside me in a bar in Pozzuoli. The husband struck up a conversation with me. He asked if I speak French since I'm from Canada. 
      Another older man asked me that the first time I was coming back from Pozzuoli. I had to break it to both of them, no. This man says next, verbatim: "My wife, 
      not know English. She smoke too much." While putting his fingers to his lips as if holding a dart. I missed exactly what he said next, either "My wife have 
      too much.. alcohol(?)" or "time"... and then points downward saying "qui". As he half-stands talking to me, she gets up to leave, and I notice her age in 
      her movement. He instinctually puts his arm out to steady her. "Married 85 years." I hear him say. I don't really believe what I've heard, until he puts his 
      fingers up, 8 and then 5. Maybe just together 85 years... teenage sweethearts. Otherwise I'm looking at people over 100 years old. That was my last surreal 
      moment of the day.<br>
      The second was as I was walking along Lago D'Averno, a short 10 minute walk from the Lucrino train station. I look up at the vineyards surrounding the lake, 
      I see invasive cacti and agave climbing the arid countryside. I have so long tied invasiveness with colonialism, its strange seeing the new world plants wreck 
      havoc on the old. These are still the after-effects of colonialism, I realize. But it seems messier somehow.

    <h3>Pozzuoli</h3>
    <p><b>November 26, 2023</b><br><br>
      On the Cumana train to Pozzuoli, I saw a lot of graffiti. A crudely drawn stick man with the title: BOB REA DEI NAPOLI (King Bob of Naples). I love this 
      almost American internet-style humour. It gives me a sense of commonality when everything around me is different. A woman boarded the train and went "brr", 
      rubbing her arms. Somehow she did it in Italian. Also, only Italian bars will go from the most beautiful ballad in Italian to Kesha's Tiktok into Katy Perry.<br>
      Leaving Pozzuoli:<br>
      Goodbye sweet little town. Like every other tourist, I have imagined a potential life here, hastily and poorly envisaged. You would hate me for this 
      caricature I'm sure, but it will stay with me forever. When I write, little pieces of this place will seep its way in. The Tyrrhenian was cold and lonely, 
      but I'll still remember it with a fondness, a place where I could let the sights can change how I think.<br>
      My ego feels shredded here. My Italian is not celebrated, but not judged either. I feel myself scraping by, asking others to repeat themselves in a slower 
      and calmer tone. I feel cared for, passed gently between help-desks: Here is an Inglese, handle with care. Speak slowly to him and make sure he knows where 
      he's going. Any pride I could have is gone, and thats probably a good thing. I know when I'm in Canada again it will come back. I'll not ask for directions, 
      or ask for information to be repeated to me.

  <h3>Celebrating from a Naples park bench</h3>
  <p><b>November 25, 2023</b><br><br>
    The park is empty. It's cold and my ears hurt. Every Neapolitan has 4 layers on, like its February. Now this is wet cold- I'm not shivering but my hand moves l
    ike molasses. Sono mi compleanno. The mountains across the Bay of Naples are very clear. This bench is wet. My hand is slowly getting faster though. 
    I think I'm lonely, I'm not sure how to fix that. Talking on the phone or sharing funny internet things doesn't really make me feel fulfilled. Maybe I am 
    extroverted after all. There's snow on Mount Vesuvius. I'm off to Lido Mappatella to dip my toes in the ocean. Wash my boots of Ontarian road salt and 
    Pompeii ash.

  <h3>Cisterns and forgetting things</h3>
  <p><b>November 24, 2023</b><br><br>
  I saw some cisterns on the Palatine hill. Due to the swampy geography of Rome, people have lived on this hill for a long time-elevated above the muck. 
  This is probably why the purported cave Romulus and Remus were raised in is on the Palatine slopes. At one point these cisterns sat at the entrance to 
  Augustus' home-complex. It was in the modern excavation of these cisterns they found old coins, offerings to forgotten gods, and bones. These all sat 
  beneath the Roman concrete that lined the bottom of the pool. Surely, back then, they knew these things were old... but did they care? 
  Did the pits their ancestors were sacrificed into become garden ornaments?

  <h3>Last day in Rome</h3>
  <p><b>November 22, 2023</b><br><br>
    At the McDonalds in Roma Termini, waiting for my train to Napoli. There isn't any of the beeping I'm used to. So much of our dystopia is asinine and 
    fruitless, even in the cruel sadistic sense. The workers here still have that 1000 yard stare. <br><br>
    Some thoughts on my return to Napoli: <br>
    We should support our hockey teams the way Italians support their football teams. Banners from every store, rafter and clothes lines littered, I mean 
    literally littered, they look tossed and forgotten. 
    It looks like they never cleaned up the parade... only for me to find out Napoli's club came in third this year. Third!

  <h3>Rapid-fire taxi backseat ideas</h3>
  <p><b>November 20, 2023</b><br><br>
  In my taxi on my way to the Vatican, I wrote some thoughts on my phone. Here they are. <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Placing too many pins on Apple Maps to possible visit</li>
    <li>Crossed the Tiber. Had an instinct to reach and grab an orange hanging outside the cab. I didn't.</li>
    <li>Was Rome always this tropical? The birds...</li>
    <li>People assuming I'm American. I said caffè! I probably butchered it.</li>
    <li>Accidentally ordered salmon instead of salami. Should've said salsiccia I know the word. Fear of being judged has me acting more American than 
      anything else I guess.</li>
    <li>Italian Pop Smoke? Heard out of another cab. Also heard a K-pop song out of a Fiat.</li>
    <li>Navy (the colour) is very very "in" right now. Can't  tell if its a tourist colour or if Romans are in love with it.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Notes from the train into Rome</h3>
    <p><b>November 19, 2023</b><br>
    <br>Some notes from the train into Rome, which happened a few days ago now but oh well.<br><br>
  A - I would like to learn some more about these Stone Pines. Their peculiar shape intrigued me, especially compared to the great evergreen Christmas trees my 
Canadian eyes are used to. Immediately in my mind, they represented the quasi-tropical climate on this latitude that continues to confuse me. (Side note, as of 
Nov. 21 I have seen 6 parakeets and 3 orange trees! Sorry to muddy the timeline, back to transcribing Nov 19 train notes). Okay to describe their shape: lacking 
lower limbs, spread out circularly at the top, all leaves (needles? Need a closer look) pointing up. The ecological sifnigicance of this, in my mind, could be 
two-fold. First, a cost-effective way to absorb sunlight. No costly lower limbs to maintain that acquire little to no sunlight. Second, abundant sun! 
Exploit this clime and specialize into sucking up every ray. However, a few problems I can't solve: why are they found in clumps, with no other plants taking 
advantage of the understory? Surely this limbless-trait of the stone pines was not adopted from competition with other trees, or to conserve space. I will look up 
more about this before I embarass myself further.<br><br>
B - I had a bit of a religious moment on the train. From my plane the landscape was beautiful, but from the train, the Appenines took a godly form. I could 
understand Roman paganism from this vantage point. The sun cast through the clouds onto hamlets. Smoke rose from a chalet isolated from the town. Dozens of sheep, 
tended by a man with a stick... a Biblical scene. A radio tower on a hill that I was convinced was a steeple of a church, until we bounded closer. We reached 
200km/hr and my ears popped going through the mountain tunnels. Terracotta roots in those towns, the same red as in the Pompeii I saw yesterday. A tractor, 
whose tires turned in slow motion to the speed of the train. This ferrovaria is a gift, to see the country with such ease. I want to take it to further and 
abandon my stop... an hour is too short to absorb it all.<br><br> Why, in all this space, had they decided to live so close together? All these little villages 
across Campagna. Some artifact of a deeper time, when we needed and leaned on each other, and couldn't get into our isolating macchina and go home. Each hamlet, 
with houses tall and crammed together on the hillside, looked like a family. I suppose they were.<br><br> I paid for my coffee this morning and the man said no 
when I got up to leave. He forced me to sit down and take my time. It was not a nicety. It was an insult to his service to move quickly. <br><br> I think if it 
rained here (in the country of Italy), I would cry. Surely this has never happened, as this is the last vestige of paradise on Earth. (Side note, it rained in 
Rome on Nov 20, I didn't cry but everyone's mood was definitely darkened).</p>

    <h3>Frankfurt flight</h3>
    <p><b>November 15, 2023</b><br>
      <br>The CN Tower looks clean in the crisp November air. It's not even 4 and dusk has settled. The great tarmac serengetti is alive with 
      roaming packs of of luggage carts, and insectile fluorescent vests. The lady beside me doesn't speak English. This feeling is familiar,
       like a family holiday, but with no one to turn to speak to.
       <br><br>
      Coming into Frankfurt at night, the streets looked like suburbia. Surely this arterial American disease has not spread its way here.
      There were a lot more streetlights. Towers with way too many red airplane warning lights (I count exactly six on each rooftop). In between 
      these curving streets were great pools of black, I associate them with lakes, but I've realized they're forests. The dimmest of tail-lights specked 
      them, and headlights shone through these pits like flashlights in a horror movie, cascading cones that faded a few feet in front of them.<br>
      The windows fogged once we landed. The trees across the tarmac stood like slender white ghosts, barely perceptible in the black. The sun rose 
      once I got to my gate. The clouds looked German: scrunchy and ready to say "Guten morgen" a bit too loudly. Everyone is busy and knows what 
      to do. I feel like I might be the only one really here.

   <h3>Another entirely too personal anecdote</h3>
   <p><b>August 4, 2023</b><br>
   <br><p>My Dad and I both have ADHD. I remember his advice at 17: set priorities, don’t doddle, sit down and focus, really focus.
   I thought back then he wasn’t speaking to me, but to his teenage self. As I get older, I’m painfully aware of how much 
   he was talking to me. To see one’s problems play out again in front of them is a horror my Dad never deserved. 
   To try and earnestly prevent them again for me is more than I could ever ask. <br><br>
   On a related tangent (as he used to say), I’d sometimes realize 3 hours into our monthly 15-minute phone call that there wasn’t 
   anybody on the planet like this man. And that these conversations mean more than the world to me. These phone calls would begin with
   “I have a midterm tomorrow morning…” Answered with: “That’s okay I’m halfway out the door to Home Depot.” 3 hours later, we’re 
   talking about Cleopatra and the size of Roman carts. Or the glacial lake beds that everybody in Owen Sound drives over everyday. 
   Conversations spilled out of us: it was the easiest thing in the world. It’s been the hardest thing in the world to lose. <br>
   Happy birthday Dad.

    <h3>On blogs as a too-quickly forgotten medium and why I am writing one</h3>
    <p><b>March 7, 2023</b><br>
      <br>
      I suppose I will start with a personal anecdote: I lost my father to cancer two weeks ago.
      Grief is a powerful motivator, and suddenly the fear of making a fool of myself on the internet has dissipated.
      Perhaps a stupid way to start this, because I will not be talking about it more. For my first blog post, let's talk about blogs.
      <br><br>
      Twenty or so years ago the internet changed how we share about ourselves. I was also born then, so I am partial to these first few years of blood-curdling 
      modem screams. A plain-text HTML file became the modus operandi for the technologically literate, from sharing their day-to-day to weird little 
      stick figure comics (I am particularly fond of xkcd thanks to my high school programming teacher). From what I have heard, as I was far too young to remember,
      people that started blogs began to have a bit of a reputation. Sharing all about yourself on the internet was not common in those days, before the 
      advent of social media and its ilk. Blogging was not particularly popular: "geek" was still in the population's vocabulary and every negative stereotype associated with it.
      Towards the end of the aughts, as they are increasingly called, social media rose from the basements of Silicon Valley, poised to grasp our then well-functioning
      Aunts and Uncles into the tendrils of conspiracy groups a little over a decade later.
      <br><br>
      If my disenfranchisement with the state of the internet is not clear yet, I am disenfranchised with the state of the internet.
      There is too much to sift through and what is left in the sieve is not that remarkable anyway.
      In a time where this could all have been generated by a large language model, I find myself asking if there is any way to prove I even exist, let alone grab someone's attention.
      In an even bleaker aspect, how to grab someone's attention who is not used to reading letters on a lonely white void.
      More and more, I find myself on little islands in the world wide web, grasping to a forum here or a group chat there.
      The internet might work best in small communities after all, which I hope is what Mastodon has right.
      So, with humility, I am carving out this piece of the internet the old-fashioned way. Typing in an HTML file, committing to main, hoping what I write is 
      entertaining or informative. This void provides no feedback of any kind to tell me I am doing okay. Slowly, I am learning not to look back so much and keep pedalling forward.
      Dad's got his hands off the bicycle now.<br><br>
