# This is my life list

1, Red-winged Blackbird, Panama Flats, May 2024, On a bird walk led by Evan Lewis. It's call is supposed to sound robotic but it reeks of rehersal. Which can only mean flesh-y.
2, Common/American Crow, Quadra Village, June 11 2024, It takes 6 seconds for me to pass a crow's nest every day. It does not go unnoticed bc the caws are endless.
3, Mallard, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 3 2024, A kerfuffle between two individuals seen from the pollinator meadow looking into the saltmarsh. Who knows over what.
4, Hooded Merganger, Lakeshore Leith, Feb 2024, A visitor at Mom's. I named him Ferdinand for someone I no longer know.
5, Common Flicker, Leith, April 2024, Consulted Hannah because I couldn't reach my phone in time. It was pecking in Mom's lawn as Hannah said they often do.
6, European Starling, Quadra Village Fairways, June 15 2024, Frequently heard but seldom seen in this parking lot. If my hands were unburdened with bags I might have fed him.
7, Glaucous-winged Gull, Uplands Park, May 10 2024, My first foray into gull ID. Hannah corrected.
8, Cooper's Hawk, Near Royal Athletic Park, June 11 2024, Pestered by a crow as Hannah pointed out.
9, Great Blue Heron, Victoria International Marina, June 6 2024, A heron pruning itself in the early morning. Fresh green sea gunk in the first low tide. Helicopters off to scout. I love the smell of jet fuel.
10, Anna's Hummingbird, Tseycum, June 14 2024, For X-thousand heartbeats it rested on a branch above me as I ate my sandwich. I was sat in a circle with deeply ecologically minded nature freaks.
11, Black Oystercatcher, Balmacarra Park, May 7 2024, Discovered with Quinn. Their shrieks remind us of the Pokémon we grew up with. As the tide rolled in my bag (left carelessly) got soaked.
12, Chipping Sparrow, Uplands Park, May 10 2024, Pointed out by Hannah as we tried to locate a possible deer carcass. Unsuccessful.
13, Song Sparrow, Spiral Beach, June 15 2024, Calls between the waves. The Olympics reveal themselves over the afternoon as clouds depart.
14, Trumpeter Swan, Leith, August 29 2023, The local residents swam right into Bothwell's Creek. The closest I've ever seen them.
15, Spotted Towhee, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 1 2024, Walking up to the Nature House it did it's normal insane theatrics to distract me. It didn't work. I had a concession stand to open.
16, Cedar Waxwing, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 5 2024, Up close as I was carrying pan traps from the pollinator meadow.
17, Bald Eagle, Tseycum, June 14 2024, I have seen this bird before but this date gets remembered. Thought ab my time pulling ivy here all week and restoration work suddenly revealed itself to me.
18, Black-capped Chickadee, Hibou, March 2024, A birdhouse along the trail in Hibou has a tenant. It's call is Dad's. His voice is in every one.
20, Violet-green Swallow, Panama Flats, May 6 2024, Pointed out by Evan Lewis on his birdwalk.
21, Semipalmated Plover, Panama Flats, May 6 2024, Pointed out by Evan Lewis on his birdwalk.
22, Least Sandpiper, Panama Flats, May 6 2024, Pointed out by Evan Lewis on his birdwalk.
23, Western Sandpiper, Panama Flats, May 6 2024, Pointed out by Evan Lewis on his birdwalk.
24, Common Yellowthroat, Panama Flats, May 6 2024, Pointed out by Evan Lewis on his birdwalk.

28, Harlequin Duck
29, Common Merganser
30, Brown-headed Cowbird
31, House Sparrow, Shelbourne Apartment, May 23 2023, The first time I ever used Merlin. Sorely disappointed bc these guys sound a lot cooler than they look.
32, European Robin, Naples, November 17 2023
33, Rose-ringed Parakeet, Parco degli Aquedotti Rome, November 21 2023

50, Western Screech Owl, I forget, June 17 2024, Some wonderful people took a drunken me to hear my 50th bird last night. I can't remember where they took me but there's an owl out there that does.
51, Red-tailed Hawk, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 18 2024, Emily pointed this one out. Like the Cooper's Hawk I saw a few weeks ago it was being pestered by crows. I've got to stop meeting them like this.
52, Bewick's Wren, Quadra Village, July 4 2024, Something smaller than a sparrow rested on the railing outside my front door. It's tongue waggled with its upward facing symphony. So so small.
