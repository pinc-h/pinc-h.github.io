# This is my life list

1, Red-winged Blackbird, Panama Flats, May 2024, On a bird walk led by Evan Lewis. It's call is supposed to sound robotic but it reeks of rehersal. Which can only mean flesh-y.
2, Common/American Crow, Quadra Village, June 11 2024, It takes 6 seconds for me to pass a crow's nest every day. It does not go unnoticed bc the caws are endless.
3, Mallard, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 3 2024, A kerfuffle between two individuals seen from the pollinator meadow looking into the saltmarsh. Who knows over what.
4, Hooded Merganger, Lakeshore Leith, Feb 2024, A visitor at Mom's. I named him Ferdinand with someone I no longer know.
5, Common Flicker, Leith, April 2024, Consulted Hannah because I couldn't reach my phone in time. It was pecking in Mom's lawn as Hannah said they often do.
6, European Starling, Quadra Village Fairways, June 15 2024, Frequently heard but seldom seen in this parking lot. If my hands were unburdened with bags I might have fed him.
7, Glaucous-winged Gull, Uplands Park, May 10 2024, My first foray into gull ID. Pointed out by Hannah.
8, Cooper's Hawk, Near Royal Athletic Park, June 11 2024, Pestered by a crow. Pointed out by Hannah.
9, Great Blue Heron, Victoria International Marina, June 6 2024, A heron pruning itself in the early morning. Fresh green sea gunk in the first low tide. Helicopters off to scout. I love the smell of jet fuel.
10, Anna's Hummingbird, Tseycum, June 14 2024, For X-thousand heartbeats it rested on a branch above me as I ate my sandwich. I was sat in a circle with deeply ecologically minded nature freaks.
11, Black Oystercatcher, Balmacarra Park, May 7 2024, Discovered with Quinn. Their shrieks remind us of the Pok√©mon we grew up with. As the tide rolled in my bag (left carelessly) got soaked.
12, Chipping Sparrow, Uplands Park, May 10 2024, Pointed out by Hannah as we tried to locate a possible deer carcass. Unsuccessful.
13, Song Sparrow, Spiral Beach, June 15 2024, Calls between the waves. The Olympics reveal themselves over the afternoon as clouds depart.
14, Trumpeter Swan, Leith, August 29 2023, The local residents swam right into Bothwell's Creek. The closest I've ever seen them.
15, Spotted Towhee, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 1 2024, Walking up to the Nature House it did it's normal insane theatrics to distract me. It didn't work. I had a concession stand to open.
16, Cedar Waxwing, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 5 2024, Up close as I was carrying pan traps from the pollinator meadow.
17, Bald Eagle, Tseycum, June 14 2024, I have seen this bird before but this date gets remembered. Thought ab my time pulling ivy here all week and restoration work suddenly revealed itself to me.
18, Black-capped Chickadee, Hibou, March 2024, A birdhouse along the trail in Hibou has a tenant. It's call is Dad's. His voice is in every one.

28, Harlequin Duck
29, Common Merganser

50, Western Screech Owl, I forget, June 17 2024, Some wonderful people took a drunken me to hear my 50th bird last night. I can't remember where they took me but there's an owl out there that does.
51, Red-tailed Hawk, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 18 2024, Emily pointed this one out. Like the Cooper's Hawk I saw a few weeks ago it was being pestered by crows. I've got to stop meeting them like this.
52, Dark-eyed Junco, Downtown Victoria, July 3 2024, The sun is setting over a fire escape downtown. A little haven carved out by Shania, feeders affixed to the window. She tells me there's a regular called One-foot John. This one had two.
53, Chestnut-backed Chickadee, Downtown Victoria, July 3 2024, Again on Shania's fire escape. She tells me there's no Black-capped Chickadee on the island. An unceremonious realization. The orange light hits them well.
54, Bewick's Wren, Quadra Village, July 4 2024, Something smaller than a sparrow rested on the railing outside my front door. It's tongue waggled with its upward facing symphony.
55, Killdeer, Patricia Bay Hwy, July 2023, The details here are fading but a moment is etched. Against a near-black sky it curves past the treeline. P.O.B.H Index: 1.
56, Great Horned Owl, Fernwood Victoria, July 27 2024, Perched at the tip of a conifer backdropped by moonlight. To stop a bunch of nerds talking is quite a feat.

64, Yellow Warbler, Esquimalt Gorge Park, August 22 2024
65, Greater White-fronted Goose, Cedar Hill Rec. Centre, October 8 2024, Pecking in the golf course like our normal residents too. Majestic in the rain. Glad I checked iNat today.
66, Barred Owl, Tolmie Ave, Victoria November 10 2024. Almost walked into her staring at my phone. Scared her onto a telephone pole, where I watched for 20min. Regal in attitude, but I know not all that smart.
